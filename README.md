# Pennyboard 27" with underglow

This is the firmware to turn a 27 inch Pennyboard into an awesome board with remote controllable LED underglow.

## Features

- Multiple non-blocking animations with WS2812B LEDs (including "Night Rider" K.I.T.T. laser scanner animation)
- Controllable with IR remote (colors, animations/effects, on/off, energy save mode)
- Motion detection (pushing, braking) - but needs a lot of tweaking :-)
